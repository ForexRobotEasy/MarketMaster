## MarketMaster Expert Advisor

MarketMaster is a simple expert advisor designed for the MetaTrader 5 platform. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, but please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. This sample code demonstrates how the MarketMaster expert advisor works based on its description and can be used as a reference for understanding the functionality of the actual product.

### Description

MarketMaster is a trading robot that aims to open buy positions when certain conditions are met. It checks the current spread of the selected symbol and ensures that it is within an acceptable range. If the spread is too high, the expert advisor exits the function without taking any action. If the spread is within the acceptable range, the expert advisor checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it calculates the lot size based on the free margin available in the trading account. It then opens a buy position using the calculated lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

### Key Parameters

- `SPREAD_THRESHOLD`: The maximum acceptable spread in points.
- `STOP_LOSS`: The stop loss level in points.
- `TAKE_PROFIT`: The take profit level in points.

### How it Works

1. The expert advisor initializes necessary variables and indicators in the `OnInit()` function.
2. On each tick, the expert advisor retrieves the current bid and ask prices of the selected symbol and calculates the spread.
3. It checks if the spread is within the acceptable range specified by the `SPREAD_THRESHOLD`. If the spread is too high, the expert advisor exits the function.
4. It then checks if there are any open positions using the `PositionsTotal()` function. If there are open positions, the expert advisor exits the function.
5. If there are no open positions, it calculates the lot size based on the free margin available in the trading account. The lot size is calculated as 1% of the free margin divided by the `STOP_LOSS` value.
6. If the calculated lot size is greater than 0, the expert advisor opens a buy position using the `OrderSend()` function. It sets the stop loss and take profit levels based on the bid price and the `STOP_LOSS` and `TAKE_PROFIT` values respectively.
7. If there is an error in opening the buy position, the expert advisor prints an error message.
